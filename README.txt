THis is a small, hack-and-slash style game that is the first game I ever developed. in order to run it, you First
need to ensure that you have Python installed. This app was designed on 3.11
then, navigate to the folder this project is stored in on you computers command terminal and run
'''pip install -r requirements. txt'''
to install the modules used for this game. from there, you can run Game.py to play the game

It's short and sweet, not a lot of substance, but I'm still proud of it as my first and Honest game.

THere are three scenarios:

Desert Battle: Defeat the wolves! They're fierce, and they dont hold back. Beware, the tumbleweeds will
slowly sap your health as they hit you, though they can be destroyed with a sword.

Plains Adventure: There are five evil cabbage looking dudes that are trying to put the Hurt on ya.
They're not the ones you're interested in. Eat the healthy, vaguely-cabbage looking things (each one
gains you 20HP), without being defeated, and victory is yours!

Delve into the Testing Zone: one can be a bit tricky: The spooky skull dude is after you, and he's your toughest
foe yet! His moves are Random: there is no rhythm or reason to them. Here is a hint: He always pauses before he
rushes you, so if hes not moving, be careful!
