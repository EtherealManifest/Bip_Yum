'''when the game runs gameplay, it needs to read in a scenario. the scenario will consist of
enemies and locations, the background tiles, and the music. the scenario will be loaded at gameplay, and
then run until a completion event occurs, be it the player dying or the enemies all dying.
once the scenario is complete, this main file will return all the local variables to their
defaults and await the next scenario
